Dominos Para Los Dominicanos
=======
This is my final project for my introduction to programming course. It is a game called Dominos that is played quite
frequently by my family.

The game is written in Python. The main library that it uses is pygame. In order to run it on a mac follow the instructions
found here http://web.mit.edu/6.090/www/pygame.html

To find all the files neccesary for the game to run go here

Have fun !!!!!.
